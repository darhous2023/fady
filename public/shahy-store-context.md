## 3. Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **Next.js 16** (App Router) | Server + client components |
| Database | **PostgreSQL** via Supabase | Connection pooler port 6543 |
| ORM | **Drizzle ORM** | Schema in `src/lib/db/drizzle/schema/` |
| Auth | **Better Auth** | Admin sessions AND customer accounts (emailAndPassword + admin plugin) |
| Deployment | **Vercel** | Auto-deploy from main branch |
| Image Storage | **Supabase Storage** | Bucket: `product-images` |
| Admin UI | **Tailwind CSS** | Standard utility classes |
| Storefront UI | **Inline styles** | No CSS framework — design system enforced via inline style objects |
| Fonts | Google Fonts | Tajawal, Cinzel, Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond |

### Auth Architecture
- **Admin auth**: Same Better Auth instance. Admins checked against `admins` table.
- **Customer auth**: Better Auth `emailAndPassword` — customers sign up at `/signup`, sign in at `/signin`.
- **Auth client**: `src/lib/auth/client.ts` exports `signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut`, `useSession`.
- **Auth server**: `src/utils/auth.ts` — `auth.api.getSession({ headers })` used in API routes.
- **Admin middleware**: `src/lib/auth/middleware.ts` → `getSessionFromRequest(req)` used in all admin APIs.

```

### Critical Security Rule
Supabase is **NEVER** accessed directly from the client. All database operations go through Next.js API routes. `DATABASE_URL` and all secrets are server-side only, never exposed to the browser.

| `is_active` | boolean | Can pause without deleting |

**Active codes as of June 2026:**
- `SHAHY10` — 10% off, min order 200 EGP
- `WELCOME50` — 50 EGP fixed off, min order 500 EGP

## 9. Business Rules

### Ordering Process
1. Customer adds items to cart (stored in localStorage/context)
2. Customer applies coupon code if available (validated via `/api/discounts/validate`)
3. Customer fills out: name, phone, governorate, address (checkout page)
4. Shipping fee is **live from DB** via `/api/shipping` — admin changes take effect immediately
5. Customer clicks "تأكيد الطلب" — order saved to DB with status `pending`, cart cleared, redirect to `/order-confirmed`
6. Store owner sees order in `/admin/orders` and updates status manually

### Payment
- **No online payment gateway**
- Accepted: Cash on Delivery (COD)
- Payment happens physically at delivery

### WhatsApp Number Rules
- **Store owner (orders)**: +201015835455 — used in all customer-facing WhatsApp links
- **Developer (technical)**: +201030002331 — shown in footer "designed by" section and admin guide support CTA
- If the store owner's number changes: update in `/admin/settings` AND update `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` in Vercel environment variables + redeploy

### Reviews
- All reviews require admin approval before appearing on the site
- Approved reviews appear in the homepage carousel, sorted by rating (highest first)

### Flash Deals Logic
- Only products with **all three**: `status = 'active'` AND `is_featured = true` AND `compare_at_price > price` appear in Flash Deals section
- Managed from `/admin/flash-deals` — toggle is_featured, set compare_at_price inline
- Flash section settings (on/off, title, end date) editable in `/admin/flash-deals` settings panel OR `/admin/settings`
- The countdown timer runs based on `flash_deals_ends_at` setting

### Customer Accounts & Dashboard
- Customers register at `/signup`, sign in at `/signin` (unified — also redirects admins to `/admin/dashboard`)
- **World-class account dashboard** at `/account/profile`: 5 tabs — نظرة عامة / طلباتي / الكوبونات / الإشعارات / بياناتي
- Orders tab shows 4-step timeline tracker (pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered)
- Coupons tab shows valid/used/expired codes with copy-to-clipboard
- Notifications tab shows new products added in the last 30 days
- **Profile editing**: "بياناتي" tab has a full edit form — name, phone, Instagram/Facebook/TikTok URLs
- **Avatar upload**: Click the avatar in the hero card → file input → `POST /api/account/avatar` → Supabase Storage bucket `avatars` → public URL stored in `customers.avatar_url`
- **Checkout pre-fill**: if logged in, name and phone auto-filled from session + customer record
- **Order linking**: checkout sends `customer_id` so orders are linked to customer UUID (not just phone match)
- Account linked to orders: `GET /api/account/me` returns full customer record (incl. social links); `PATCH /api/account/me` updates name/phone/social URLs
- Customer accounts are separate from admin accounts

### AI Image Prompt
- Available at `/ai-image-prompt.md` (public file, downloadable)
- A world-class prompt for transforming any product photo into a luxury ad image using ChatGPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, or Midjourney
- Includes: full prompt, short prompt, video prompt, usage tips, recommended free tools
- Accessible from the admin guide download bar

### Coupons
- Discount is applied client-side at cart calculation
- The order saved in DB reflects the final discounted total

### Categories
- Categories with products **cannot be deleted** (foreign key RESTRICT — returns error with product count)
- Move products to another category first, then delete
- `is_active = false` hides category from storefront without deleting

## 14. Known Limitations

| Limitation | Status | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| No online payment | Active | COD — physical payment at delivery |
| No automated notifications | Active | Store owner gets WhatsApp message; manual follow-up |
| No stock reservation | Active | Stock can go negative if not monitored |
| WhatsApp checkout fallback | Active | If customer closes WA without sending, order still saved in DB as pending |
| No multi-language | Active | Arabic only |
| Orders not auto-linked to accounts | Active | Orders matched by phone — customer must use same phone as registered |
| No email verification / password reset | Active | Needs SMTP config (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` in env) |
| Checkout not pre-filled from account | Active | Could be added: read session → prefill name/phone from customer record |

## 15. Development Roadmap — What's Left

### ✅ Completed (Phases 1–4)
- Full storefront (home, product detail, cart, checkout, wishlist, track, sale, FAQ)
- Admin panel: products, orders (+ CSV export), reviews, categories (CRUD), shipping, discounts, banners, settings, admins, guide (13 sections)
- Flash Deals dedicated admin page
- Customers admin table
- Customer accounts: `/signin`, `/signup`, `/account/profile` (world-class 5-tab dashboard), `/account/orders`
- **Profile editing**: name, phone, social links (Instagram/Facebook/TikTok)
- **Avatar upload**: Supabase Storage `avatars` bucket via `POST /api/account/avatar`
- Checkout pre-fill from session + customer record
- Order-to-account auto-link (`customer_id` in orders)
- GA4 wired (needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` env var)
- SEO: JSON-LD structured data, robots meta, expanded keywords
- Admin guide: 13 sections incl. ads guide + AI image prompt section
- AI image prompt file at `/ai-image-prompt.md`
- Handover document at `/admin/guide/handover`
- Realistic product reviews seeded (30 reviews across 10 products)
- Shipping live from DB (not hardcoded); sitemap cleaned

### 🔄 Pending (user actions, no code needed)
- **GA4**: Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX` to Vercel env vars
- **Meta Pixel**: Add via Facebook Events Manager for ad conversion tracking
- **Avatar storage bucket**: Create `avatars` bucket in Supabase Storage (public read) + add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to Vercel env
- **Email/SMS notifications**: Requires SMTP setup (optional)
- **Online payment**: Paymob or Fawry (requires merchant account)
- **Transfer ownership**: Vercel + Supabase + GitHub → client account

### ⚠️ Manual steps not yet done (user hasn't done these)
- No SMTP configured → password reset not working
- No registered customers yet (feature is ready, awaiting real users)
- No products marked as flash deals yet (admin needs to set is_featured + compare_at_price)
